"TODO: Clean - Hamerik, Asger",Federal Hill (flexible),,,,"Federal Hill, where you are now standing, originally had a different name and function: Back when it was known as Signal Hill, it played a vital role in the process of allowing shipping lines to communicate with each other. 

An example of what could go wrong can be seen by looking at the 1891 collision of the steamships ""Cartheginian"" and ""Charlotte"" in the Baltimore port's shipping channel. 

The Danish-born Baltimore composer Asger Hamerick was among the passengers aboard the ""Cartheginian,"" and while neither ship sank, each one was damaged enough to delay its trip.

Joseph Pache,UMMC Midtown (formerly Maryland General Hospital),,,,"You're now standing across the street from the UMMC Midtown hospital, where the conductor, composer and arranger Joseph Pache died in 1926. We could just as easily put this tour stop inside a meat market several blocks to the south, however. 

When Pache came to Baltimore from New York in the late 1800s, the composer was being asked by local musical leaders to take charge of the Baltimore Oratorio Society, but according to Baltimore Sun archives, it wasn't the musicianship of the group that sealed the deal: Pache is said to have moved the the city after delighting at the variety of foods found in Lexington Market's stalls. 

Once he had decided that he liked the food here, Pache -- who had been born in Germany and trained in Berlin -- wasted no time in moving to Baltimore, where he conducted a group that sometimes included more than 300 singers in its performances. Near the end of his career, Pache also started an oratorio society in York, Pennsylvania, which is now considered a Baltimore suburb. 

Pache was a friend of Asger Hamerik, with whom he occasionally collaborated. ",,"39.300208, -76.620031",757,

Kaiser. ","You are now standing outside North America's oldest music conservatory, The Peabody Institute, which now operates as part of The Johns Hopkins University. 

Along with several of the other composers mentioned in this tour, the list of people educated or employed by Peabody over the years has included Phillipp Glass, Marin Alsop, Tori Amos, Hilary Hahn, André Watts, Elliott Carter, Barry Tuckwell and Leon Fleisher. 

For all its merits, the Peabody has the kind of complicated, unjust and often embarrassing history shared by many institutions south of the Mason-Dixon line: During much of the 20th century, for example, African American applicants were automatically rejected. 

The pianist Ellis Larkins may have been the first exception to that policy, according to The Baltimore Sun. Larkins died in 2002. (http://bit.ly/1WOJKwm)

Zappa (Frank),,,,,"For all his many faults, industrialist Enoch Pratt was a leader in the creation of free library resources. The Pratt Free Library in front of which you are now standing sits across the street from the oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States, and the library played a similarly important role in many Baltimoreans' lives. Frank Zappa, the prolific leader of the Mothers of Invention ensemble, was -- intentionally or not -- echoing Pratt with one of his most famous quotes: ""If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to a library.""

Zappa, who was born in Baltimore in 1940, was a master at going against the grain. A vocal champion of free speech, the rocker and composer testified on Capitol Hill against censorship measures. While Zappa's music tended to be classified as ""novelty"" or ""joke"" music, he often used his complex meters, virtuosic arrangements and absurdism to address political and moral issues ignored by most popular musicians of the time. Zappa died in 1993. ",,"39.294569, -76.616873",407000,

"Boyle, George Frederick",War Memorial Plaza (Zion Church),,,,"You should now be standing on War Memorial Plaza, facing East. The domed structure in front of you is Baltimore's city hall. To your left is the Baltimore Police headquarters. To your right is Zion Lutheran Church of the City of Baltimore, where on Feb 7, 1915, the once-divorced pianist and composer George Frederick Boyle was married to his second wife, who was a student in his piano studio. 

The church where the marriage took place -- a congregation that was founded in 1755, predating the United States itself -- would have been one of Baltimore's musical focal points at the time. 

The combination of a strong German-American /Maenerchor/ tradition and the German-heavy staffing of the Peabody Institute meant that Zion had already established a hefty musical tradition by the time Rev. Julius Hofmann published his ""Deutsches Liederbuch : Sammlung von Chorälen und Liedern für Schule und Haus"" in 1895 (http://bit.ly/1EO9Sot). 

According to newspaper clippings from the early 1900s, the polymath Rev. Hofmann -- who was said to know 14 languages and taught at Johns Hopkins -- presided over at least one other scandalous musical marriage at Zion, performing a rushed ceremony in 1925 to wed a 56-year-old conservatory professor and his teenage violin student. 

Both the musical and cultural traditions are still alive at Zion, though the shotgun weddings have thankfully tapered off. Along with Saturday German classes, the sanctuary continues to host weekly Lutheran services in German and English, and the church is a member of the ""Bach in Baltimore"" concert circuit. In autumn 2015, the church was the Baltimore venue for the four-city tour of the Hamburg-based choir Kantorei Gross-Flottbek. 

As of 2015, this plaza also faces a second musical venue: The neoclassical War Memorial on the east side of the plaza can seat 1,100 people and is home to a repeating concert series, frequently featuring local composers and performers.  

But back to our composer friend at Zion, George Frederick Boyle.

As we said, shortly after divorcing his Dutch first wife, Boyle was married by Rev. Hofmann to one of his students, Avery Forney. That second marriage ended in a Reno divorce less than a decade later, with Forney publicly decrying Boyle's insistence on having yet another mistress. 

While his marriages were short-lived, Boyle's music has survived the interstitial century, thanks largely to the recent efforts of Australian pianist Timothy Young. You can hear some of Young's performances of Boyle's work at http://bit.ly/1FxpZRX 

Boyle's career spanned a childhood in Sydney, a musical training period in Europe, his decade in Baltimore and a later teaching career in Philadelphia and New York, where his students included Samuel Barber. Among other pieces, Boyle's output included nine orchestral works, two concertos, eight works of chamber music and more than 70 piano pieces. 

George Frederick Boyle died in Philadelphia on June 20, 1948. He was 61 years old. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgO5sWTMb58,39.29100 -76.60964,1980,
