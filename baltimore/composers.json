When Pache came to Baltimore from New York in the late 1800s, the composer was being asked by local musical leaders to take charge of the Baltimore Oratorio Society, but according to Baltimore Sun archives, it wasn't the musicianship of the group that sealed the deal: Pache is said to have moved the the city after delighting at the variety of foods found in Lexington Market's stalls. Once he had decided that he liked the food here, Pache -- who had been born in Germany and trained in Berlin -- wasted no time in moving to Baltimore, where he conducted a group that sometimes included more than 300 singers in its performances. Near the end of his career, Pache also started an oratorio society in York, Pennsylvania, which is now considered a Baltimore suburb.  Pache was a friend of the Danish-American composer Asger Hamerik, with whom he occasionally collaborated.

Follow it four blocks back to Charles Street, then go south by half a block. ","description":"You should now be standing on War Memorial Plaza, facing East. The domed structure in front of you is Baltimore's city hall. To your left is the Baltimore Police headquarters. To your right is Zion Lutheran Church of the City of Baltimore, where on Feb 7, 1915, the once-divorced pianist and composer George Frederick Boyle was married to his second wife, who was a student in his piano studio.  The church where the marriage took place -- home to a congregation that was founded in 1755, predating the United States itself -- would have been one of Baltimore's musical focal points at the time.  The combination of a strong German-American /Maenerchor/ tradition and the German-heavy staffing of the Peabody Institute meant that Zion had already established a hefty musical tradition by the time Rev. Julius Hofmann published his <em>Deutsches Liederbuch : Sammlung von Chor√§len und Liedern f√ºr Schule und Haus</em> in 1895 (see <a href='http://bit.ly/1EO9Sot' target='_blank'>http://bit.ly/1EO9Sot</a>).  According to newspaper clippings from the early 1900s, the polymath Rev. Hofmann -- who was said to know 14 languages and taught at Johns Hopkins -- presided over at least one other scandalous musical marriage at Zion, performing a rushed ceremony in 1925 to wed a 56-year-old conservatory professor and his teenage violin student.  Both the musical and cultural traditions are still alive at Zion, though the hurried weddings seem to have tapered off. Along with Saturday German classes, the sanctuary continues to host weekly Lutheran services in German and English, and the church is a member of the &quot;Bach in Baltimore&quot; concert circuit. In autumn 2015, the church was the Baltimore venue for the four-city tour of the Hamburg-based choir Kantorei Gross-Flottbek. <br><br>As of 2015, this plaza also faces a second musical venue: The neoclassical War Memorial on the east side of the plaza can seat 1,100 people and is home to a repeating concert series, frequently featuring local composers and performers.  <br><br>But back to our composer friend at Zion, George Frederick Boyle. As we said, shortly after divorcing his Dutch first wife, Boyle was married by Rev. Hofmann to one of his students, Avery Forney. That second marriage ended in a Reno divorce less than a decade later, with Forney publicly decrying Boyle's insistence on having yet another mistress.  While his marriages were short-lived, Boyle's music has survived the interstitial century, thanks largely to the recent efforts of Australian pianist Timothy Young. Boyle's career spanned a childhood in Sydney, a musical training period in Europe, his decade in Baltimore and a later teaching career in Philadelphia and New York, where his students included Samuel Barber. Among other pieces, Boyle's output included nine orchestral works, two concertos, eight works of chamber music and more than 70 piano pieces.  George Frederick Boyle died in Philadelphia on June 20, 1948. He was 61 years old.","youtube":"XgO5sWTMb58","coords":"39.29100 -76.60964","compimage":"ZionLexingtonsnow.JPG","imagedescription":"Image released under a Creative Commons 3.0 license.

The Danish-born Baltimore composer Asger Hamerik was among the passengers aboard the <em>Cartheginian,</em> and while neither ship sank, each one was damaged enough to delay its trip. As a friend of Berlioz and director of the Peabody Institute, Hamerik was a major celebrity in Maryland, with a huge group of resources at his disposal. This allowed him to write and stage very large works, including his 7th symphony and requiem, requiring large orchestras and hundreds of singers. <br><br>As for Hansa House -- which was probably not where Hamerik bought his Cartheginian tickets, since that ship was run by Allan Line -- the structure later played an infamous role in World War I.
