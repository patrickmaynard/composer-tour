Remaining TODO items:
x Briefly create an internal fork to explore the idea of using an image rather than a background. That will allow filters. http://alistapart.com/article/finessing-fecolormatrix
x Success! Merge the fork. 
x I like this image so much that I don't need any others. xredit it at the end.  
x Re-run the EXPORT > GDOCS > MR DATA CONVERTER  workflow, removing inactives at the GDOCs stage. Make sure the image credit is live.  
x Now get rid of the imagxxcredit logic/field. 
x Also get rid of the logic that subs in background images, since those aren't needed now. 
x Get rid of anything in the "backgrounds" folder other than the crabs.
x Make the display work on tiny screen sizes.
x Remove the sn counter from the interface.
x Fix bug that causes Safari not to load slides.
x Fix bug that causes Chrome to miss the color filter.
x Abstract all javascript and styles to their own files.
x Add a small bit of animation to transition?
x Push this to a github.io site for testing purposes.
x More cross-browser testing at UB on IE. (This is actually largely redundant, since this will be wrapped in a Cordova layer.)
x (The feColorMatrix filter fails in IE, which also has wonky margins at mobile width.)
  (But again, this doesn't matter, because this will all be wrapped by Cordova.)
- Fix flash-of-black in cordova if possible  
	(^It turns out that this is caused by the remote map reload. So use screenshots to make this into a local image instead.)
- Wrap output in a cordova-based wrapper, test some more.
- Using a bootstrap template, create a super-simple composertours.org site that points users at the app. 
- Release into the world, distributing simple flyers advertising the tour.
- Add a title tag to the tour.
- GET RID OF THIS TODO LIST, replacing it with a readme file.
- Create a <noscript> version of the app content using CLI PHP or Python. 
  (^This can merely show descriptions - no need for tabular content to show in searches.)
- Move this inline TODO list to a readme file.
- Manually update the wording on the last slide to be sure it says something generic in the sign-off.
- Wrap output in a cordova-based wrapper, test some more. 
- Possibly using a bootstrap template, create a super-simple composertours.org site that points users at the app. 
- Release into the world, distributing simple flyers advertising the tour. 
- Add a link or canonical reference on the noscript version of the page, pointing at the app version.

			Welcome to the Baltimore composer walking tour, which shows visitors sites of importance in Baltimore's musical history. This tour is for the most part confined to the area between the midtown and downtown neighborhoods, in order to avoid making visitors walk too far. This tour requires javascript.
